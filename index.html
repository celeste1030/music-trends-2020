          <h3>Analysis of Health Risks based on Income, Age and Poverty</h3>
          <p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> The percentage of people who lack healthcare is most affected by <strong>poverty</strong> showing that healthcare is a luxury that many Americans unfortunately cannot afford.  <strong>Median age</strong> is similar across all states and does not impact the percentage of people without healthcare. <strong>Median income</strong> also does not affect lack of healthcare.  Texas for example has the highest percentage of people who lack healthcare with a median income of 53,035. Other states such as West Virginia and Kentucky have lower median incomes and lower percentage of lacking healthcare.</p>

          <p><strong>Smokers:</strong> The percentage of people who are smokers are affected by all three demographics.  States with lower <strong>median income</strong> have a higher percentage of smokers.  States with an older <strong>median age</strong> tend to have more smokers.  Increased level of <strong>poverty</strong> leads to a greater number of smokers.</p>

          <p><strong>Obesity:</strong> Obesity is most affected by <strong>median income</strong>.  The lower the median income the higher the obesity rate per state.  <strong>Poverty</strong> levels also greatly affect obesity. States with a high poverty level have high obesity rate.  Age does not affect obesity since states with similar <strong>median age</strong> have different obesity levels.</p>
